The DOM is a programming API for documents. It is based on an object structure that closely resembles the structure of the documents it models. 
For instance, consider this table, taken from an HTML document:
In the DOM, documents have a logical structure which is very much like a tree; to be more precise, which is like a "forest" or "grove", 
which can contain more than one tree. Each document contains zero or one doctype nodes, one root element node, 
and zero or more comments or processing instructions; the root element serves as the root of the element tree for the document. However, 
the DOM does not specify that documents must be implemented as a tree or a grove, 
nor does it specify how the relationships among objects be implemented. The DOM is a logical model that may be implemented in any convenient manner. 
In this specification, we use the term structure model to describe the tree-like representation of a document. 
We also use the term "tree" when referring to the arrangement of those information items which can be reached by using "tree-walking" 
methods; (this does not include attributes). One important property of DOM structure models is structural isomorphism: 
if any two Document Object Model implementations are used to create a representation of the same document, 
they will create the same structure model, in accordance with the XML Information Set
